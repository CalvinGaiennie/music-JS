              <h2>Learn the Notes on The E and A Strings First</h2>
              <p>Learning the notes on the E and A string will be very useful when using barre chords, power chords, and scales. Also with the octive trick I am going to show you later you can know the name of any note on the fretboard instintaniously if you know the notes on the E and A string.</p>

                Hack To Easily Learn The Fretboard
              </h2>
              <h3>Here's the fastest way to learn the notes on the fretboard.</h3>
              <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Memorize the notes on the E and A string</p>
              <img src="../Assets/Photos/LEN.jpg" />
              <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Memorize the Octive Shapes</p>
              <p>These shapes always make an octive no matter what fret you start on.</p>
              <p>Because of this the note under both fingers is the same.</p>
              <p>The one on the higher string is simply an octive higher.</p>
              <img src="../Assets/Photos/OG.png" />
              <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you dont know a note use an octive shape to trace it back to the E or A string</p>
              <p>
                For example: You want to know what note is on the third fret of the D string. Use the first octive shape to trace it back.
                <br>
                Put your second finger on the third fret of the D string, and your first finger on the first fret of the low E string.
              </p>
              <img src="../Assets/Photos/FOS.png" />
              <br />
              <p>Bonus Tip: The E strings are tuned the same so the note on any fret on one E string is the same on the other E string. The 5th fret of both string is A, the 8th fret on both strings is C...</p>

              <h2> How to Get The Most Out of the Pentatonic Scale</h2>
              <h3>What is the pentatonic scale</h3>
              <p>The pentatonic is a lead guitarists bread and butter.</p>
              <p>It is often used to write riffs, licks, intros, outros, and solos.</p>
              <p>Singers Often write melodies using this scale whether they know it or not.</p>
              <p>There are two main types of pentatonic scale, the major pentatonic and the minor pentatonic.</p>
              <p>They use the same shapes but the root notes are in different locations (i'll show you what this means later)</p>
              <h3>How to learn it</h3>
              <p>Learn this shape and how to use it in its major and minor forms</p>
              <p>Learn this shape, how to connect it to the previous one, how to switch between them, and how to use them both in their major and minor forms. EX.</p>
              <p>Learn the rest of the shapes and how to connect them all the way through</p>
              <p>Learn other people solos riffs and licks to show you cool way to use it</p>
              <p>check out these lead patterns</p>
              <h3>Major vs Minor and mixing</h3>
              <p>The Major Pentatoic is the major scale with no fourth and no 7th.</p>
              <p>The minor Pentatonic is the Minor Scale with no second and no sixth</p>
              <h3>How does it work</h3>
              <p>This is not essential information but i'm putting here for anyone curious.</p>

              <h2>Triads</h2>
              <p>What is a triad?</p>
              <p>A chord is just three notes right?</p>
              <p>Here is every major chord shape, that does'nt repeat any notes, on the entire fretboard.</p>

              <h2> Arpeggios</h2>
              <h3>What is an arpegggio.</h3>
              <p>An arpeggio is a scale made up only of chord tones.</p>
              <p>An A major Arpeggio consists only of the notes in an A major schord. A C# and E</p>
              <p>A CminMaj7 arpeggio contains the notes in a C minor major 7 chord: C Eb G and B</p>
              <p>Sadly unlike the pentatonic scale the major and minor arpegio shapes are not identical, however some are similar.</p>

              <h2>This exercise changed my understanding of the guitar.</h2>
              <p>To do this exercise you must know: how to find every instance of a note on the fretboard using your octive shapes, the caged system, arpeggio shapes, and the pentatonic scale.</p>
              <p>Each shape of each of these things correspond with a specific shape in all of the other things. EX.</p>
              <p>This never changes. Doing this exercise will help you associate a chord shape with its relivant pentatonic and arrpeggio shape which will give you instant access to them anywhere on the fretboard.</p>
              <p>Give a couple examples of using this association to access the different shapes when switching from playing lead to rythym</p>
