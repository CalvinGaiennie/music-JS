          <h2 id="notes" class="bold">The Notes in Music.</h2>
          <p>
            There are 12 notes in western music. 
            <p>A note is simply a frequency that we have asssigned a name to.</p>
            <p>These are the notes.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#</strong> (# stands for
              sharp)</p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Notice there are no sharps between B and C or between E and F.
            </p>
            <br>
            A, <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">A#</span>, B, C,
            <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">C#</span>, D,
            <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">D#</span>, E, F,
            <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">F#</span>, G,
            <span class="colorChange" style="color: red">G#</span>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The notes that have #'s (sharps) in them can also be referred to as b's
            (flats) but we will get into that later, for now just think of them as
            #s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every fret on the fretboard makes the sound of one of these 12 notes. We
            name each location on the fretboard by the
            sound that it makes. For example every green circle in the photo below
            makes a G sound. Some are in different octives but they all make a G.
            Take a look at this diagram and notice that all 12 notes are there. Grab your guitar and a tuner, play some notes, and see if they
            coorespond to this diagram. (If your guitar is tuned than they will)
          </p>

          <img src="../Assets/Photos/FN.jpg" />
          <img src="../Assets/Photos/LEN.jpg" />
          <br>
          <p>
           Open strings are named after the note that we normally tune them to. For example if you play the low E string open it makes an E sound
           <!-- , if you put your finger on the third fret of the low E -->
            <!-- string and pluck the string it makes a G sound. -->
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong>
            <br>There are 12 notes in music. 
            <br> A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#<br>
             Memorize Them. <br>
            To easily learn their locations on the fretboard see fretboard hack on page 2.</p>

            <h2 id="majorScale" class="bold">The Major Scale</h2>
            <h3>What is a scale?</h3>
            <p>
              A scale is a formula that helps us group notes together. 
            </p>
            <h3>The Major Scale</h3>
            <p>The Major scale
              is the scale that all of western music is based on.
              Pretty much all music theory traces it's roots back to the major scale.</p>
            <!-- <p>
              Learning the major scale will make it possible for you to easily figure
              out what key a song is in, know what chords are in a key, what notes are
              in a chord, what notes are in a scale as well as many other things.
            </p>
            <p>Understanding the major scale is essential for understanding basic music theory and therefor is essential for communicating with other musicians.</p>
            <p>If you're on stage at a blues jam and you're lost and the bass player holds up four fingers to you be better hope you know that he is telling you that the song is currently on the four chord and that because you are in the key of Bb the four chord is is Eb. BTW because guitar is shape based if you know what youre doing you dont even really need to know what the four chord is, only what key youre in and that you should be playing the four chord.</p> -->
            <p>
              The major scale is a seven note scale based on two different intervals (distances in music)
              half steps and whole steps, a half step is equal to one note. This means
              when you move over a half step you move over one fret (one note) and
              when you move over a whole step you move over two frets(two notes).
            </p>

            <h3>Major Scale Formula</h3>
            <p>
              So I said a scale is a formula right? Well what is the formula for the
              Major scale?
            </p>
            <p>The major scale Forumla is: W, W, H, W, W, W, H</p>
            <!-- <p>
              Here is an example. Photo and examples written out showing all the notes
              and how major scales are derrived from them.

          <h2 id="chords">How to make major and minor chords.</h2>
          <h3>
            How to make a major chord?
          </h3>
          <p>To make a major chord you need three notes, the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the corresponding Major Scale.
            For example the key of C is C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. <br>
            So a C major Chord contains C E and G.</p>
          <img src="a" /> <!-- put a photo showing all of the notes in a C Chord-->
          <p>An A major scale is A, B, C#, D, E, F#, and G# <br>
          So an A Major Chord contains A, C#, and E</p>
          <img src="a" /> <!-- put a photo showing all of the notes in a A Chord-->
          <h3>How to make a minor chord.</h3>
          <p>To make a minor chord you do the same thing and flatten the third</p>
          <p>So if an A major scale is A, B, C#, D, E, F#, and G# <br>
          An A Minor Chord contains A, C and E and a C minor Chord contains C Eb and G</p>
          <img src="a" /> <!-- put a photo showing all of the notes in a C minor Chord-->
          <img src="a" /> <!-- put a photo showing all of the notes in a C Major Chord-->
          <p>Then show triads or the caged system to show how many different ways you can make a C chord and an A chord and an A minor chord</p>
          <p>The caged system is just barre chords and its awesome</p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2 id="key">What are the chords in a key and how to find them.</h2>
          <p>If you want the simple answer here is it.</p>
          <p>Take a major scale. Turn the 1st, 4th, and 5th, note into major chords, the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th notes minor chords, and the 7th note a diminished chord. <button class="'diminished">WTF is a diminshed chord?</button></p>
          <p>Example: the C major scale is C, D, E, F, G, A, and B.</p>
          <p>The key of C major is C, Dminor, Eminor, F, G, Aminor and B diminished (when talking about chords if the quality is not specificed it is assumed that the chord is major, so if someone says D chord they mean a D major chord. Also diminished chords are signified with the degree symbol Â° but diminished chords are rarely used so you dont really need to worry much about them.)</p>
          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <p>
            If you want to know why this is then here we go. 
            Insert charts explaining all the notes in all the chords in a few keys ideally with an interactive diagram that walks you through it.
